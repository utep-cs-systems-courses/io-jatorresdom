## Description

This program implements one state machine to toggle the LED once each second.

## Suggested Activities

* Blink the red and green LEDs in alternation.
You can trigger the LED alternation just adding this line of code PIOUT ^= LED_RED;


* Change the speed that the LEDs blink.  (e.g. twice or half as fast)

Make the second count reset when it is more that 125 instead of 250 it will
blink faster.
